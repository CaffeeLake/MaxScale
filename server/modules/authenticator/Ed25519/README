This plugin uses public domain ed25519 code by Daniel J. Bernstein, Niels Duif,
Tanja Lange, Peter Schwabe and Bo-Yin Yang.

The code was extracted from https://bench.cr.yp.to/supercop/supercop-20221122.tar.xz
and can be found in the "crypto_sign/ed25519/ref10"-directory.

==============================
Changes:

crypto_sign() does not take the public key as argument and instead calculates
it from the password as in crypto_sign_keypair(). Also, does not return signed
message length as it's already known.

crypto_sign_open() only returns the result of the verification (passed/failed),
not the verified message.

crypto_sign_keypair() derives the private key from the cleartext password
instead of generating it from random data.
